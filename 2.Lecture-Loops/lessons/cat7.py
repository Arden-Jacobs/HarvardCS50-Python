# cat7.py - Demonstrates a For Loop Using an Underscore (_) as a Variable

# Use a for loop with an underscore (_) as a variable
for _ in range(3):
    print("meow")



# Explanation:
# This code illustrates the use of a for loop with an underscore (_) as the loop variable. The underscore is
# often used as a placeholder variable when the actual value of the variable is not needed in the loop body.

# For Loop with Underscore Variable:
# The for loop employs the range(3) function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 3.
# During each iteration, the variable _ is utilized as a placeholder to signify that the loop variable's
# value is not used in the loop body.

# Loop Body:
# Inside the loop, the print("meow") statement is executed. This results in the string "meow" being printed
# to the console during each iteration of the loop.

# Loop Iteration:
# The loop iterates three times, corresponding to the generated sequence of numbers [0, 1, 2].
