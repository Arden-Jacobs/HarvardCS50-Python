# cat9.py - Introduces the continue and break Statements

while True:
    n = int(input("What's n? "))
    if n <= 0:
        continue
    else:
        break

for _ in range(n):
    print("meow")



# Explanation:
# This code introduces the usage of the continue and break statements within a while loop and a subsequent for loop.

# While Loop: Input Validation
# The while True: loop is an infinite loop that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a value for n.
# Inside the loop, the input value is converted to an integer using int(input("What's n? ")).
# The if n <= 0: condition checks if n is less than or equal to 0.
# If the condition is met, the continue statement is executed, which skips the remaining code in the loop and
# goes to the next iteration, prompting the user for input again.
# If the condition is not met (i.e., n is positive), the else: block is executed, and the break statement is
# encountered, which terminates the while loop.

# For Loop: String Multiplication
# After the while loop exits, the code enters a for loop using the value of n obtained from the user.
# The loop runs n times, with _ as a placeholder variable.
# Inside the loop, the string "meow" is printed, generating the output "meow" repeated n times.

# Executing this code involves the following steps:
# The user is prompted to input a value for n.
# If n is not a positive integer, the input prompt repeats until a valid value is entered.
# Once a valid positive integer is entered, the loop terminates.
# The for loop runs n times, printing "meow" for each iteration.
