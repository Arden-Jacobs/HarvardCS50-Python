# Explanation:
# This code demonstrates the use of functions to enhance modularity and readability. It includes three functions:
# main(), get_number(), and meow().

# Function Definitions:
# main(): This function serves as the entry point of the program. It calls the meow() function with the return
# value of the get_number() function as its argument.
# get_number(): This function prompts the user to input a positive integer. It uses a while loop to repeatedly
# prompt the user until a valid value greater than 1 is entered. Once a valid value is obtained, it is returned.
# meow(n): This function takes an integer n as its argument and prints the string "meow" n times using a for loop.

# Execution Flow:
# The program starts by calling the main() function.
# Inside main(), the get_number() function is called to obtain a positive integer value n.
# The obtained value of n is then passed as an argument to the meow(n) function, which prints "meow" n times.

# Entry Point:
# The if __name__ == "__main__": statement ensures that the code inside it is executed only when the script is run
# directly (not imported as a module). This is a best practice to keep the code modular and reusable.
# By using functions, the code is organized into smaller, more manageable sections, improving its clarity and maintainability.
