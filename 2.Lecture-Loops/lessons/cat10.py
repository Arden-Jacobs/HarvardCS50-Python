# cat10.py - Removing the continue Statement

# Prompt the user for a positive integer n
while True:
    n = int(input("What's n? "))
    if n > 0:
        break

# Print "meow" n times using a for loop
for _ in range(n):
    print("meow")



# Explanation:
# This code is similar to the previous version (cat9.py), but the continue statement has been removed by reversing
# the condition in the if statement.

# While Loop: Input Validation
# The while True: loop is an infinite loop that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a value for n.
# Inside the loop, the input value is converted to an integer using int(input("What's n? ")).
# The if n > 0: condition checks if n is greater than 0.
# If the condition is met (i.e., n is positive), the break statement is executed, which terminates the while loop.

# For Loop: String Multiplication
# After obtaining a valid positive integer n, the code enters a for loop using the value of n.
# The loop runs n times, with _ as a placeholder variable.
# Inside the loop, the string "meow" is printed, generating the output "meow" repeated n times.

# Executing this code involves the following steps:
# The user is prompted to input a positive integer value for n.
# If the entered value is not positive, the input prompt repeats until a valid value is entered.
# Once a valid positive integer is entered, the loop terminates.
# The for loop runs n times, printing "meow" for each iteration.
# The output depends on the value of n
