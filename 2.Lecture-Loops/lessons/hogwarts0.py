# hogwarts0.py - Demonstrating Indexing into a List

# List of students' names
students = ["Hermione", "Harry", "Ron"]

# Print each student's name using indexing
print(students[0])  # Output: Hermione
print(students[1])  # Output: Harry
print(students[2])  # Output: Ron



# Explanation:
# This code demonstrates how to access and print elements from a list using indexing.

# List Definition:
# The students list is defined with three strings representing students' names: "Hermione", "Harry", and "Ron".

# Indexing and Printing:
# Each print statement uses indexing to access a specific element from the students list and print it.
# students[0] accesses the first element of the list, which is "Hermione".
# students[1] accesses the second element, which is "Harry".
# students[2] accesses the third element, which is "Ron".
# This code snippet showcases how to retrieve and use individual elements from a list by their index positions.
