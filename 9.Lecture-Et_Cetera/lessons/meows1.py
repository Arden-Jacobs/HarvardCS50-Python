# File Name: meows1.py
# Description: This script demonstrates the use of a class constant named 'MEOWS' to control the number of times the word 'meow' is printed.

# Define the 'Cat' class with a class constant 'MEOWS' set to 3.
class Cat:
    MEOWS = 3

    # 'meow' method within the 'Cat' class.
    def meow(self):
        # Use a 'for' loop to iterate 'MEOWS' times and print "meow" during each iteration.
        for _ in range(Cat.MEOWS):
            print("meow")

# Create an instance of the 'Cat' class.
cat = Cat()
# Call the 'meow' method to make the cat meow.
cat.meow()

# Explanation:
# Description: This script showcases the utilization of a class constant, 'MEOWS', to regulate the number of times the word 'meow' is printed.
# The script contains the following components:
# - 'Cat' class: It defines a class constant 'MEOWS' with a value of 3, which determines how many times the word 'meow' will be printed.
# - 'meow' method: Inside the 'Cat' class, there's a 'meow' method that uses a 'for' loop to iterate 'MEOWS' times, printing "meow" during each iteration.
# - Instance creation: An instance of the 'Cat' class is created using the variable 'cat'.
# - Method call: The 'meow' method is called on the 'cat' instance, making the cat meow three times.
# The script offers an example of how class constants can be used within a class to control behavior.
