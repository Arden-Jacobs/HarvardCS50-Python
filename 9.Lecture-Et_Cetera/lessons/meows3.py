# File Name: meows3.py
# Description: This script demonstrates a type hint error (Argument ... has incompatible type) that can occur when using input without proper type casting.

# Define the 'meow' function, which takes an integer 'n' as an argument and prints "meow" 'n' times.
def meow(n: int):
    for _ in range(n):
        print("meow")

# Prompt the user for input and store it in the 'number' variable.
number = input("Number: ")

# Call the 'meow' function with the 'number' input, which may result in a type hint error if 'number' is not an integer.
meow(number)

# Explanation:
# Description: This script highlights a type hint error that can occur (Argument ... has incompatible type) when using input without proper type casting.
# The script contains the following components:
# - 'meow' function: It is defined with a type hint to expect an integer 'n' as an argument and uses a 'for' loop to print "meow" 'n' times.
# - Input prompt: The user is prompted to enter a number, and the input is stored in the 'number' variable.
# - Function call: The 'meow' function is called with the 'number' input, which may lead to a type hint error if 'number' is not correctly typed as an integer.
# The script serves as an example of the importance of type hints and proper data type casting in Python.
