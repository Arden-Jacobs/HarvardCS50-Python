# File Name: meows7.py
# Description: This script demonstrates proper annotation of a function's return value, indicating that 'meow' does not return a value (None).

# Define the 'meow' function, which takes an integer 'n' as an argument, prints "meow" 'n' times, and annotates its return type as 'None'.
def meow(n: int) -> None:
    for _ in range(n):
        print("meow")

# Prompt the user for input, convert it to an integer, and store it in the 'number' variable with a type hint of 'int'.
number: int = int(input("Number: "))

# Call the 'meow' function with the 'number' input, knowing that it does not return a value, and assign 'None' to 'meows'.
meows: str = meow(number)

# Print 'meows', which will always display 'None' as the 'meow' function is annotated to return 'None'.
print(meows)

# Explanation:
# Description: This script demonstrates the proper annotation of a function's return value, indicating that 'meow' does not return a value (None).
# The script contains the following components:
# - 'meow' function: It is defined to expect an integer 'n' as an argument, print "meow" 'n' times, and is annotated with a return type of 'None' to indicate it doesn't return a value.
# - Input prompt: The user is prompted to enter a number, and the input is converted to an integer using 'int()' and then assigned to the 'number' variable with a type hint of 'int'.
# - Function call: The 'meow' function is called with the 'number' input, and 'None' is assigned to 'meows' as the function does not return a value.
# - Print statement: The 'meows' variable is printed, displaying 'None' as the 'meow' function is annotated to return 'None'.
# The script illustrates proper function annotation for clarity in Python code.
