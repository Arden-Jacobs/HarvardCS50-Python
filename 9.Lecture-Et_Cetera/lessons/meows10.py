# Explanation:
# Description: This script uses Sphinx-style docstring format to document the 'meow' function, providing detailed information about its purpose, parameters, possible exceptions, and return value.
# The script contains the following components:
# - 'meow' function: It is defined to expect an integer 'n' as an argument and returns a string containing "meow" repeated 'n' times. A Sphinx-style docstring is added to document the function, specifying its parameters, possible exceptions, and return value.
# - Input prompt: The user is prompted to enter a number, and the input is converted to an integer using 'int()' and then assigned to the 'number' variable.
# - Function call: The 'meow' function is called with the 'number' input, which returns a string, and the result is assigned to 'meows'.
# - Print statement: The 'meows' variable is printed without adding an extra newline character to the end.
# The script demonstrates the use of Sphinx-style docstring format for documenting Python functions.
