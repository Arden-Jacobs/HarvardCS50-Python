# File Name: meows6.py
# Description: This script demonstrates a common mistake by assuming that the 'meow' function has a return value when it does not.

# Define the 'meow' function, which takes an integer 'n' as an argument and prints "meow" 'n' times.
def meow(n: int):
    for _ in range(n):
        print("meow")

# Prompt the user for input, convert it to an integer, and store it in the 'number' variable with a type hint of 'int'.
number: int = int(input("Number: "))

# Call the 'meow' function with the 'number' input and assign the result to 'meows', which will be None as 'meow' does not return a value.
meows: str = meow(number)

# Print 'meows', which will display 'None' as the 'meow' function has no return value.
print(meows)

# Explanation:
# Description: This script highlights a common mistake where it's assumed that the 'meow' function has a return value when it does not.
# The script contains the following components:
# - 'meow' function: It is defined with a type hint to expect an integer 'n' as an argument and uses a 'for' loop to print "meow" 'n' times. It does not return a value.
# - Input prompt: The user is prompted to enter a number, and the input is converted to an integer using 'int()' and then assigned to the 'number' variable with a type hint of 'int'.
# - Function call: The 'meow' function is called with the 'number' input and the result is assigned to 'meows', which will be 'None' as 'meow' does not return a value.
# - Print statement: The 'meows' variable is printed, displaying 'None' as the 'meow' function has no return value.
# The script serves as an example of understanding functions and their return values in Python.
