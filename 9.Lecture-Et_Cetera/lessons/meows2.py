# File Name: meows2.py
# Description: This script demonstrates a TypeError that can occur when trying to use a non-integer input as the number of times to meow.

# Define the 'meow' function, which takes an integer 'n' as an argument and prints "meow" 'n' times.
def meow(n):
    for _ in range(n):
        print("meow")

# Prompt the user for input and store it in the 'number' variable.
number = input("Number: ")

# Call the 'meow' function with the 'number' input, which may result in a TypeError if 'number' is not an integer.
meow(number)

# Explanation:
# Description: This script illustrates a common issue, a TypeError, that can occur when trying to use a non-integer input as the number of times to print "meow."
# The script contains the following components:
# - 'meow' function: It is defined to take an integer 'n' as an argument and uses a 'for' loop to print "meow" 'n' times.
# - Input prompt: The user is prompted to enter a number, and the input is stored in the 'number' variable.
# - Function call: The 'meow' function is called with the 'number' input, which may lead to a TypeError if 'number' is not a valid integer.
# The script serves as an example of potential issues with input validation and data types in Python.
