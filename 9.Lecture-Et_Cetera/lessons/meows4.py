# File Name: meows4.py
# Description: This script demonstrates an incompatible types error (Incompatible types in assignment) that can occur when trying to assign user input directly to a variable with a specified type hint.

# Define the 'meow' function, which takes an integer 'n' as an argument and prints "meow" 'n' times.
def meow(n: int):
    for _ in range(n):
        print("meow")

# Prompt the user for input and store it in the 'number' variable with a type hint of 'int'.
number: int = input("Number: ")

# Call the 'meow' function with the 'number' input, which may result in an incompatible types error if 'number' is not an integer.
meow(number)

# Explanation:
# Description: This script illustrates an incompatible types error (Incompatible types in assignment) that can occur when trying to assign user input directly to a variable with a specified type hint.
# The script contains the following components:
# - 'meow' function: It is defined with a type hint to expect an integer 'n' as an argument and uses a 'for' loop to print "meow" 'n' times.
# - Input prompt: The user is prompted to enter a number, and the input is assigned to the 'number' variable with a type hint of 'int'.
# - Function call: The 'meow' function is called with the 'number' input, which may lead to an incompatible types error if 'number' is not correctly typed as an integer.
# The script demonstrates the importance of correctly handling data types and type hints in Python.
