# File Name: meow0.py

# Description: This script demonstrates the use of a constant named 'MEOWS' to control the number of times the word 'meow' is printed.

# Define the constant 'MEOWS' with a value of 3.
MEOWS = 3

# Use a 'for' loop to iterate 'MEOWS' times and print "meow" during each iteration.
for _ in range(MEOWS):
    print("meow")
    
# Explanation:

# Description: This script serves as a simple demonstration of using a constant, 'MEOWS', to control the number of times the word 'meow' is printed.

# The script consists of the following components:

# - 'MEOWS' constant: It is defined at the beginning of the script with a value of 3. This constant determines how many times the word 'meow' will be printed.

# - 'for' loop: A 'for' loop is used to iterate 'MEOWS' times, which is currently set to 3. During each iteration, the string "meow" is printed to the console.

# The script is a basic illustration of how constants can be used to control repetitive actions in code.
