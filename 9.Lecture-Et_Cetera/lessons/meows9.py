# Description: This script adds a docstring to the 'meow' function to describe its purpose.

# Define the 'meow' function, which takes an integer 'n' as an argument and returns a string containing "meow" repeated 'n' times.
def meow(n):
    """
    Meow n times.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of times to repeat "meow."

    Returns:
        str: A string containing "meow" repeated 'n' times.
    """
    return "meow\n" * n

# Prompt the user for input, convert it to an integer, and store it in the 'number' variable.
number = int(input("Number: "))

# Call the 'meow' function with the 'number' input, which returns a string, and assign it to 'meows'.

# Print 'meows' without adding an extra newline character.
print(meows, end="")

# Explanation:
# Description: This script adds a docstring to the 'meow' function to describe its purpose and usage.
# The script contains the following components:
# - 'meow' function: It is defined to expect an integer 'n' as an argument and returns a string containing "meow" repeated 'n' times. A docstring is added to describe its purpose and usage, including argument and return value information.
# - Input prompt: The user is prompted to enter a number, and the input is converted to an integer using 'int()' and then assigned to the 'number' variable.
# - Function call: The 'meow' function is called with the 'number' input, which returns a string, and the result is assigned to 'meows'.
# - Print statement: The 'meows' variable is printed without adding an extra newline character to the end.
# The script demonstrates the addition of a docstring for function documentation in Python.
