# adieu.py - Generates a farewell message using input and inflect

# Import the inflect module for number-to-word conversion
import inflect

# Create an instance of the inflect engine
p = inflect.engine()

# Initialize an empty list to store names
lis = []

# Continuously input names until an EOFError occurs
while True:
    try:
        lis.append(input("Name: "))
    except EOFError:
        # Convert the list of names to a human-readable string using the inflect engine
        mylist = p.join(lis)
        # Print the farewell message with the list of names
        print("Adieu, adieu, to " + mylist)
        # Exit the loop
        break

# Explanation:
# This script uses the inflect module to generate a farewell message by accepting a list of names from user input.

# The import statement "import inflect" at the beginning of the script imports the inflect module, which provides
# functionality for converting numbers to words and performing other linguistic operations.

# An instance of the inflect engine is created using "p = inflect.engine()".

# An empty list "lis" is initialized to store names entered by the user.

# The while loop runs indefinitely and attempts to append user input (names) to the "lis" list. When an EOFError occurs,
# the loop is exited.

# The "p.join(lis)" statement converts the list of names to a human-readable string using the inflect engine.

# The final farewell message is printed using the converted list of names. The script concludes by breaking out of the loop.
