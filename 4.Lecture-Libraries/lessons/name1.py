# name1.py - Demonstrates IndexError handling with sys.argv

# Import the sys module to access command-line arguments
import sys

# Try to print a message that includes the provided command-line argument
try:
    print("hello, my name is", sys.argv[1])
except IndexError:
    # Handle the IndexError that occurs when there are too few command-line arguments
    print("Too few arguments")

# Explanation:
# This code demonstrates how to handle the IndexError exception that can occur when accessing
# command-line arguments using sys.argv.

# The import statement "import sys" at the beginning of the script imports the sys module, which provides
# access to variables and functions related to the Python interpreter.

# The try block attempts to execute the code inside it, which is an attempt to print a message including
# the provided command-line argument (sys.argv[1]).

# The except block is executed if an IndexError occurs within the try block. An IndexError occurs when
# there are too few command-line arguments provided. In this case, the script will print "Too few arguments."
