# Introduction to Python Programming

Welcome to the "Introduction to Python Programming" repository! This course is designed for individuals with varying levels of programming experience, including beginners. It covers essential concepts and practices of programming using the Python language.

## Course Overview

This repository contains resources and materials for learning programming with Python. The course covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Reading and writing code
- Testing and debugging techniques
- Python-specific concepts: functions, variables, types, conditionals, loops
- Handling exceptions and bug fixing
- Writing effective unit tests
- Using third-party libraries
- Regular expressions for data validation and extraction
- Object-oriented programming: classes, objects, methods, properties
- File input/output operations

## Learning Approach

The course adopts a hands-on learning approach to provide you with practical experience. Real-world programming problems inspire the exercises, enabling you to apply the concepts you've learned in a meaningful context.

## Getting Started

To begin, you can either use your own PC or Mac for coding or utilize a web browser. No specific software installation is required. Simply clone this repository and start exploring the provided resources.

## Repository Structure

- `/lessons`: Contains code examples discussed during the course.
- `/problem_set`: Includes exercises inspired by real-world programming problems.
- `/project`: Advanced projects to further practice and showcase skills (final project).
