# students6.py - Reads and sorts a CSV file containing student information into a list of dictionary objects

# Create an empty list to store student information as dictionary objects
students = []

# Open the "students0.csv" file in read mode using a context manager and loop through its lines
with open("students0.csv") as file:
    for line in file:
        # Unpack the line by splitting it into name and house using a comma as the delimiter
        name, house = line.rstrip().split(",")

        # Create a dictionary with student name and house information and directly append it to the "students" list
        students.append({"name": name, "house": house})

# Define a function to get the name from a student dictionary
def get_name(student):
    return student["name"]

# Sort the list of dictionary objects using the key function "get_name"
# This will sort the list based on the "name" value of each dictionary
sorted_students = sorted(students, key=get_name)

# Iterate through the sorted list of dictionary objects and print each student's information
for student in sorted_students:
    print(f"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}")

# Explanation:
# This script reads and processes a CSV file named "students0.csv" containing student information, similar to previous versions.

# The script starts by creating an empty list named "students" which will be used to store student information as dictionary objects.

# The script then uses a context manager to open the "students0.csv" file in read mode. The context manager automatically takes care of
# opening and closing the file.

# Inside the loop that iterates over the lines of the file, the line is unpacked using the split(",") operation. The student's name
# is assigned to the variable "name" and their house is assigned to the variable "house".

# A new dictionary is created using dictionary literal syntax. The dictionary is populated with two key-value pairs using dictionary
# assignment:
# - The "name" key is assigned the value of the student's name.
# - The "house" key is assigned the value of the student's house.

# The populated dictionary is then directly appended to the "students" list within the same line, avoiding the need for an intermediate variable.

# After processing all lines of the CSV file, the script defines a function named "get_name" that takes a student dictionary as an argument
# and returns the value associated with the "name" key.

# The script then sorts the "students" list of dictionary objects using the built-in "sorted" function. The sorting is based on the "name"
# value of each dictionary, and the "key" parameter is set to the "get_name" function, which is used to extract the "name" value for sorting.

# The sorted list of dictionary objects is stored in the variable "sorted_students".

# Finally, the script iterates through the sorted list of dictionary objects using a for loop. For each dictionary, the script uses f-strings
# to format and print the student's name and their house.

# The result is a series of formatted messages, each displaying a student's name and their house, as read from the "students0.csv" file,
# stored as dictionary objects in the "students" list, and sorted by the student's name.
