# students8.py - Reads a CSV file using csv.reader and sorts student information into a list of dictionary objects using a lambda function

# Import the "csv" module to work with CSV files
import csv

# Create an empty list to store student information as dictionary objects
students = []

# Open the "students1.csv" file in read mode using a context manager and create a csv.reader object
with open("students1.csv") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)

    # Iterate through the rows of the CSV file using the csv.reader object
    for row in reader:
        # Create a dictionary with student name and home information and append it to the "students" list
        students.append({"name": row[0], "home": row[1]})

# Use a lambda function as the key argument to the sorted function
# The lambda function extracts the "name" value from each student dictionary for sorting
sorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student["name"])

# Iterate through the sorted list of dictionary objects and print each student's information
for student in sorted_students:
    print(f"{student['name']} is from {student['home']}")

# Explanation:
# This script reads and processes a CSV file named "students1.csv" containing student information using the "csv.reader" object provided by the "csv" module.

# The script begins by importing the "csv" module.

# It creates an empty list named "students" to store student information as dictionary objects.

# Using a context manager, the script opens the "students1.csv" file in read mode and creates a csv.reader object named "reader" to read the contents.

# It then iterates through the rows of the CSV file using the csv.reader object. Each row is a list containing the values of each column.

# For each row, the script creates a dictionary with the student's name and home information using dictionary literal syntax and the values from the row.

# The newly created dictionary is appended to the "students" list within the same line of code.

# After processing all rows of the CSV file, the script uses the built-in "sorted" function to sort the list of dictionary objects.
# The "key" parameter is set to a lambda function that takes a student dictionary as an argument and returns the value associated with the "name" key.

# The sorted list of dictionary objects is stored in the variable "sorted_students".

# Finally, the script iterates through the sorted list of dictionary objects using a for loop. For each dictionary, the script uses f-strings
# to format and print the student's name and their home.

# The result is a series of formatted messages, each displaying a student's name and their home as read from the "students1.csv" file,
# stored as dictionary objects in the "students" list, and sorted by the student's name using a lambda function.
