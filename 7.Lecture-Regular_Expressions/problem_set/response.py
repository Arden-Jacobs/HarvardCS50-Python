# Explanation:

# Description: This script is designed to validate email addresses provided by the user using the 'validator_collection' library.
# It checks whether the format of the email address is valid and returns "Valid" or "Invalid" accordingly.

# We begin by importing the 'checkers' module from 'validator_collection'.

# The script defines a 'main' function, responsible for obtaining user input for the email address and validating it.

# It also defines a 'validator' function to check the validity of the email address. The function uses the 'is_email' function
# from 'validator_collection' to perform the validation.

# If the email address is valid according to the library's validation rules, the function returns "Valid." Otherwise, it returns "Invalid."

# Finally, the script checks whether it is executed as the main program. If it is, it initiates the email address validation process
# by calling the 'main' function.
