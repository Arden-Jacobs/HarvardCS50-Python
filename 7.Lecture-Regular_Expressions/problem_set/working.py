# Explanation:

# Description: This script defines a 'convert' function that is used to convert time ranges from a specific format to a standardized format.
# The script also includes a 'main' function for interactive use, allowing the user to input time ranges and see the converted format.

# We start by importing the 're' module for regular expressions.

# The script defines three functions:

# - 'main': This function is the entry point of the script. It gets the user's input for the time range and displays the converted format
#   using the 'convert' function.

# - 'convert': This function is responsible for validating and converting time ranges. It uses regular expressions to validate the input
#   against a specific pattern. If the input matches the pattern, it extracts the individual components (hours, minutes, and noon)
#   and checks if the hours are greater than 12 (not a valid format). If everything is valid, it calls the 'time_format' function to
#   format and convert the times to a standardized format and returns the converted time range. If the input does not match the expected
#   format, it raises a 'ValueError.'

# - 'time_format': This function formats hours and minutes based on whether the input includes minutes or not. It adjusts hours for AM/PM
#   and handles cases involving noon/midnight.

# The script also checks whether it is executed as the main program. If it is, it initiates the interactive process by calling the 'main'
# function, allowing the user to input time ranges and see the converted format.

# These functions ensure that the 'convert' function accurately converts time ranges from the specified format to a standardized format,
# handling validation and formatting appropriately.
