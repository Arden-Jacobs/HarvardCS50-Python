# Explanation:

# Description: This script defines a 'parse' function used to extract YouTube video links from HTML embed code.
# The script also includes a 'main' function for interactive use, allowing the user to input HTML code and see the extracted video link.

# We start by importing the 're' module for regular expressions and the 'sys' module for command-line arguments (although it's not used here).

# The script defines two functions:

# - 'main': This function is the entry point of the script. It gets the user's input for HTML code and displays the extracted video link
#   using the 'parse' function.

# - 'parse': This function is responsible for searching the input HTML code for YouTube video embed code using regular expressions. If it
#   finds a match, it extracts the video ID from the matched group and constructs a YouTube video link. If no match is found, it returns None.

# The script also checks whether it is executed as the main program. If it is, it initiates the interactive process by calling the 'main'
# function, allowing the user to input HTML code and see the extracted video link.

# These functions ensure that the 'parse' function correctly extracts YouTube video links from HTML embed code, making it easier for users
# to access the videos by providing direct links.
