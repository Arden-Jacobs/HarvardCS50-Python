# File Name: test_numb3rs.py

# Description: This script contains test cases for the 'validate' function in the 'numb3rs' module.
# We will test various scenarios to ensure that the validation of IPv4 addresses functions correctly.

# Import the 'validate' function from the 'numb3rs' module.
from numb3rs import validate

# Let's define a test case function to validate non-numeric inputs.
def test_alpha():
    # We expect these inputs to be invalid since they contain non-numeric characters.
    assert validate("cat") == False
    assert validate("cat.dog.hat.mat") == False
    assert validate("one.two.three.four") == False

# Now, let's define a test case function to validate valid and invalid IPv4 addresses.
def test_input():
    # These inputs are valid IPv4 addresses and should return True.
    assert validate("1.2.3.4") == True

    # These inputs are invalid IPv4 addresses and should return False.
    assert validate("1.2.3") == False
    assert validate("") == False
    assert validate("255.290.350.500") == False

# Explanation:

# Description: In this script, we have a collection of test cases for the 'validate' function, which is located in the 'numb3rs' module.
# The purpose of these tests is to thoroughly evaluate the functionality of the IPv4 address validation.

# We start by importing the 'validate' function from the 'numb3rs' module, which we want to test.

# The script is organized into two main sections, each containing a test case function.

# 1. The 'test_alpha' function aims to validate non-numeric inputs. We expect these inputs to be invalid IPv4 addresses because they contain non-numeric characters.
#    - For instance, "cat" contains letters, and "cat.dog.hat.mat" contains non-numeric characters and multiple periods. Similarly, "one.two.three.four" is not a valid IPv4 address.

# 2. The 'test_input' function focuses on validating both valid and invalid IPv4 addresses.
#    - In the first assertion, "1.2.3.4" is a valid IPv4 address, so we expect the 'validate' function to return True.
#    - The next assertion, "1.2.3," is not a valid IPv4 address because it lacks a fourth group. Therefore, it should return False.
#    - An empty input string "" is not a valid IPv4 address, so we anticipate a False result.
#    - Lastly, "255.290.350.500" is also invalid because it contains groups with values exceeding 255. We expect it to return False as well.

# These test cases provide comprehensive coverage to ensure that the IPv4 address validation function behaves as expected.
