# It adds validation checks within the constructor to ensure that the 'name' is not empty and the 'house' is one of the valid options.
# The script then demonstrates creating a student instance with a 'patronus' attribute and prints the student without displaying the patronus.

# Explanation:

# Description: This script defines a class 'Student' with a constructor (__init__) to represent a student with 'name', 'house', and 'patronus' attributes.
# It adds validation checks within the constructor to ensure that the 'name' is not empty and the 'house' is one of the valid options.
# The script then demonstrates creating a student instance with a 'patronus' attribute and prints the student without displaying the patronus.

# The script consists of the following components:

# - 'Student' class: This class is defined with a constructor (__init__) that takes three parameters, 'name', 'house', and 'patronus'. Inside the constructor,
#   there are two validation checks:
#   - The 'name' is validated to ensure it's not empty. If it is, a 'ValueError' is raised with the message "Missing name."
#   - The 'house' is validated to ensure it's one of the valid options: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. If it's not one of
#     these options, a 'ValueError' is raised with the message "Invalid house." If both 'name' and 'house' pass validation, the 'name', 'house', and 'patronus'
#     attributes of the 'Student' instance are initialized with the provided values.

# - '__str__' method: This method is defined within the 'Student' class to provide a string representation of the 'Student' instance. It returns a string
#   containing the student's name and house.

# - 'main': This function is the entry point of the script. It calls the 'get_student' function to collect the student's information and create
#   an instance of the 'Student' class directly. It then prints the 'student' instance directly. However, since the 'patronus' attribute is added
#   but not displayed, it's not included in the output.

# - 'get_student': This function is responsible for collecting the student's name, house, and patronus using the 'input' function. It then creates an instance
#   of the 'Student' class directly by calling its constructor and passing the collected information as arguments. The function returns the 'Student'
#   instance directly, eliminating the need for an intermediate variable.

# The script also checks whether it is executed as the main program. If it is, it initiates the interactive process by calling the 'main' function,
# allowing the user to input the student's name, house, and patronus and demonstrating how to create and print a student instance without displaying
# the patronus.
