# Explanation:

# Description: This script demonstrates how to print the type of a dictionary by creating an empty dictionary using the 'dict()' constructor.

# The script consists of a single line of code:

# - 'print(type(dict()))': This line creates an empty dictionary using the 'dict()' constructor, and then uses the 'type' function to determine
#   the type (class) of the created dictionary. Finally, it prints the result to the console. In this case, it will print the type 'dict'
#   to the console, indicating that the value is a dictionary.
