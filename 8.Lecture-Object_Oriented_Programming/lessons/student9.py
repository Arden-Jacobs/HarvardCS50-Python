# Description: This script defines a class 'Student' to represent a student with name and house attributes.
# It demonstrates how to create an instance of the 'Student' class, set its attributes, and access them in the 'main' function.

# Explanation:

# Description: This script defines a class 'Student' to represent a student with 'name' and 'house' attributes.
# It demonstrates how to create an instance of the 'Student' class, set its attributes, and access them in the 'main' function.

# The script consists of the following components:

# - 'Student' class: This class is defined to represent a student with 'name' and 'house' attributes. In this example, the class is empty,
#   but you can add methods and a constructor (__init__) to it as needed.

# - 'main': This function is the entry point of the script. It calls the 'get_student' function to collect the student's information and create
#   an instance of the 'Student' class. It then accesses the 'name' and 'house' attributes of the 'student' instance and displays them using
#   a formatted string.

# - 'get_student': This function is responsible for creating an instance of the 'Student' class and collecting the student's name and house
#   using the 'input' function. It sets the collected information as attributes of the 'student' instance and returns the 'student' instance.

# The script also checks whether it is executed as the main program. If it is, it initiates the interactive process by calling the 'main'
# function, allowing the user to input the student's name and house and demonstrates how to create and use a class instance.

# This script serves as a basic example of defining and using a class in Python to represent an entity with attributes.
