# Explanation:

# Description: This script represents a student and allows the user to input the student's name and house. It then displays the student's
# name and house using a formatted string.

# The script starts by defining a variable 'name' and uses the 'input' function to prompt the user to input the student's name. The input
# is stored in the 'name' variable.

# Next, it defines a variable 'house' and again uses the 'input' function to prompt the user to input the student's house. The input is
# stored in the 'house' variable.

# Finally, the script uses the 'print' function to display the student's name and house using a formatted string, with the placeholders
# '{name}' and '{house}' replaced by the actual values provided by the user.

# This script provides a simple way to capture and display information about a student, including their name and house.
