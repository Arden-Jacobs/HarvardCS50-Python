# Description: This script defines a class 'Student' with a constructor (__init__) to represent a student with 'name' and 'house' attributes.
# It adds validation checks within the constructor to ensure that the 'name' is not empty and the 'house' is one of the valid options.
# The script then demonstrates creating a student instance, modifying the 'house' attribute, and prints the updated student information.

# Explanation:

# Description: This script defines a class 'Student' with a constructor (__init__) to represent a student with 'name' and 'house' attributes.
# It adds validation checks within the constructor to ensure that the 'name' is not empty and the 'house' is one of the valid options.
# The script then demonstrates creating a student instance, modifying the 'house' attribute, and prints the updated student information.

# The script consists of the following components:

# - 'Student' class: This class is defined with a constructor (__init__) that takes two parameters, 'name' and 'house'. Inside the constructor,
#   there are two validation checks:
#   - The 'name' is validated to ensure it's not empty. If it is, a 'ValueError' is raised with the message "Invalid name."
#   - The 'house' is validated to ensure it's one of the valid options: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. If it's not one of
#     these options, a 'ValueError' is raised with the message "Invalid house." If both 'name' and 'house' pass validation, the 'name' and 'house'
#     attributes of the 'Student' instance are initialized with the provided values.

# - '__str__' method: This method is defined within the 'Student' class to provide a string representation of the 'Student' instance. It returns a string
#   containing the student's name and house.

# - 'main': This function is the entry point of the script. It calls the 'get_student' function to collect the student's information and create
#   an instance of the 'Student' class directly. It then modifies the 'house' attribute of the 'student' instance and prints the updated 'student'
#   instance.

# - 'get_student': This function is responsible for collecting the student's name and house using the 'input' function
