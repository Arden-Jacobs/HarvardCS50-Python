# Description: This script defines a class 'Hat' that represents a magical hat used to sort individuals into Hogwarts houses.
# It implements a 'sort' method as an instance method to randomly sort a person into one of the Hogwarts houses.
# The script creates a 'Hat' instance and demonstrates using the 'sort' method to sort a person's name into a house.

# Import the 'random' module to generate random choices.

    def __init__(self):
        self.houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]

    # Define the 'sort' method as an instance method, which takes a 'name' as input and randomly assigns it to one of the Hogwarts houses.

# Explanation:

# Description: This script defines a class 'Hat' that represents a magical hat used to sort individuals into Hogwarts houses.
# It implements a 'sort' method as an instance method to randomly sort a person into one of the Hogwarts houses.
# The script creates a 'Hat' instance and demonstrates using the 'sort' method to sort a person's name into a house.

# The script consists of the following components:

# - 'Hat' class: This class is defined to represent a magical hat. It has an initialization method '__init__' that initializes the 'Hat' instance
#   with a list of Hogwarts houses.

# - 'sort' method: This method is defined as an instance method within the 'Hat' class. It takes two parameters: 'self' (referring to the 'Hat' instance)
#   and 'name' (the name of the person to be sorted). Inside the 'sort' method, it uses the 'random.choice' function from the 'random' module to randomly
#   select one of the Hogwarts houses from the list and prints the name of the person along with the assigned house.

# - Create 'Hat' instance: An instance of the 'Hat' class is created using the following line of code:
#   hat = Hat()

# - Use 'sort' method: The 'sort' method is used to sort a person's name into one of the Hogwarts houses. For example, it sorts the name "Harry" using the
#   'hat.sort("Harry")' line of code.

# When the script is executed, it will randomly assign "Harry" to one of the Hogwarts houses and print the result.
