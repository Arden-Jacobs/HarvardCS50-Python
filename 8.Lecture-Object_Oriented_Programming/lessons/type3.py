# Explanation:

# Description: This script demonstrates how to print the type of a list by creating an empty list using the 'list' constructor.

# The script consists of a single line of code:

# - 'print(type(list()))': This line creates an empty list using the 'list' constructor 'list()', and then uses the 'type' function to determine
#   the type (class) of the created list. Finally, it prints the result to the console. In this case, it will print the type 'list' to the console,
#   indicating that the value is a list.
