# compare5.py - Demonstrates Inequality

# Prompt the user for values of x and y, and convert them to integers.
x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

# Compare x and y using inequality to determine whether they are not equal.

# If x is not equal to y, print the corresponding message.
if x != y:
    print("x is not equal to y")

# If x is equal to y, print the corresponding message.
else:
    print("x is equal to y")



# In this section, the program demonstrates the use of inequality to compare values of x and y.The input()
# function is used to prompt the user for values of x and y, which are converted to integers.The program uses
# an if statement with the inequality operator (!=) to check if x is not equal to y. If this condition is true,
# it means that x is not equal to y, and the corresponding message is printed. Otherwise, if the condition is
# false, it implies that x is equal to y, and the corresponding message is printed.
