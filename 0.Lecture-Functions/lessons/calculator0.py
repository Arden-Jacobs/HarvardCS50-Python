# calculator0.py - Basic Arithmetic

# This program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in Python.

# Variables `x` and `y` are assigned values 1 and 2 respectively.
x = 1
y = 2

# The variable `z` is assigned the result of adding variables `x` and `y`.
z = x + y

# The `print()` function is used to display the value of variable `z`.
print(z)



# In this section, we're introducing basic arithmetic operations in Python.
# We have two variables, x and y, assigned values 1 and 2 respectively. 
# The variable z is assigned the result of adding the values of x and y. 
# Finally, the print() function is used to display the value of the variable z.
