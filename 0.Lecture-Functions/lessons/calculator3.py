# calculator3.py - User Input and Integer Addition

# This program demonstrates user input, type conversion, and integer addition.

# The `int()` function is used to convert the user's input directly into integers.
# The `input()` function is used to prompt the user for the value of `x` and convert it to an integer, stored in the variable `x`.
x = int(input("What's x? "))

# Similarly, the `input()` function is used to prompt the user for the value of `y` and convert it to an integer, stored in the variable `y`.
y = int(input("What's y? "))

# The variables `x` and `y` store integer values obtained from user input.
# The integers are added using the `+` operator, and the result is stored in the variable `z`.
z = x + y

# The `print()` function is used to display the integer value of `z`.
print(z)



# In this section, we're continuing to work with user input, type conversion, and integer addition. 
# The int() function is used to directly convert the user's input into integers. The input() function
# is used twice to prompt the user for values of x and y, and the resulting integer values are used 
# for calculations. The print() function is used to display the integer value of z.
