# calculator6.py - User Input, Floating-Point Addition, and Rounding

# This program demonstrates user input, type conversion to floating-point numbers,
# addition of floating-point numbers, and direct rounding and printing.

# The `float()` function is used to convert the user's input directly into floating-point numbers.
# The `input()` function is used to prompt the user for the value of `x` and convert it to a float, stored in the variable `x`.
x = float(input("What's x? "))

# Similarly, the `input()` function is used to prompt the user for the value of `y` and convert it to a float, stored in the variable `y`.
y = float(input("What's y? "))

# The variables `x` and `y` store float values obtained from user input.
# The float numbers are added using the `+` operator, and the result is immediately rounded and printed.
print(round(x + y))



# In this section, we're showcasing user input, type conversion to floating-point numbers, addition of 
# floating-point numbers, and the direct rounding and printing of the result. The float() function is
# used to directly convert the user's input into floating-point numbers. The input() function is used
# twice to prompt the user for values of x and y, and the resulting float values are used for calculations.
#  The result of the addition is immediately rounded and printed using the print() function.
