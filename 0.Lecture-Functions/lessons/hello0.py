# hello0.py - Introduction to Python Programming

# This is a simple introductory program in Python.
# It prints the famous "Hello, world!" message to the console.

# The `print()` function is a built-in Python function that outputs text to the console.
# It takes one or more arguments and displays them as output.
# In this case, we're passing the string "hello, world" as an argument to the `print()` function.


print("hello, world")


# In this initial section, we have a basic Python program that demonstrates how to use the print() 
# function to display text. The program consists of a single line that calls the print() function with
# the argument "hello, world", resulting in the output "hello, world" being displayed in the console.
