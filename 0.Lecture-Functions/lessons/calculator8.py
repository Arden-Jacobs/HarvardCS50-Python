# calculator8.py - Floating-Point Division

# This program demonstrates floating-point division between two user-input values.

# The `float()` function is used to convert the user's input directly into floating-point numbers.
# The `input()` function is used to prompt the user for the value of `x` and convert it to a float, stored in the variable `x`.
x = float(input("What's x? "))

# Similarly, the `input()` function is used to prompt the user for the value of `y` and convert it to a float, stored in the variable `y`.
y = float(input("What's y? "))

# The variables `x` and `y` store float values obtained from user input.
# The float numbers are divided using the `/` operator, and the result is stored in the variable `z`.
z = x / y

# The `print()` function is used to display the result of the floating-point division.
print(z)



# In this section, we're demonstrating floating-point division between two user-input values. The float()
# function is used to directly convert the user's input into floating-point numbers. The input() function 
# is used twice to prompt the user for values of x and y, and the resulting float values are used for 
# calculations. The result of the division is displayed using the print() function.
