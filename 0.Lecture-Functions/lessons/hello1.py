# hello1.py - Taking User Input and Output

# This program demonstrates how to take user input, store it in a variable,
# and then display a personalized greeting using the input provided.

# The `input()` function is a built-in Python function that waits for user input.
# It displays the specified prompt (in this case, "What's your name? "),
# and the user's input is stored in the variable `name`.
name = input("What's your name? ")

# The `print()` function is used to output text to the console.
# In this case, it's used to display "hello," followed by the value stored in the `name` variable.
print("hello,")
print(name)



# In this section, we're introducing user input and output in Python. The input() function prompts the
# user with the question "What's your name? " and waits for their input. The input is then stored in the
#  variable name. After that, the print() function is used to display "hello," followed by the value stored
#  in the name variable.
