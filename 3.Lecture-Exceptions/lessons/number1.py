# number1.py - Catches a ValueError

try:
    # Attempt to get an integer input from the user
    x = int(input("Enter an integer value for x: "))
    print(f"x is {x}")
except ValueError:
    # If the user's input cannot be converted to an integer, handle the ValueError
    print("Error: The input is not a valid integer")



# Explanation:
# The code begins with a comment indicating its purpose, which is to catch a ValueError if the user
# does not input a valid integer.

# The try block is used to enclose code that may potentially raise an exception. In this case, it
# attempts to get an integer input from the user using input() and then converts it to an integer
# using int().

# The except block follows the try block. It specifies the type of exception (in this case, ValueError)
# that the code within the try block may raise. If a ValueError is raised, the code within the
# except block will be executed.

# Inside the try block, the user's input is converted to an integer and stored in the variable x. Then,
# using an f-string, the code prints a message indicating the value of x.

# If the user enters something that cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., letters, symbols), a
# ValueError will be raised. In such a case, the code within the except block will be executed,
# and it will print the message "x is not an integer."

# In summary, this code snippet uses a try and except structure to handle the possibility of a
# ValueError occurring when attempting to convert the user's input to an integer. If a
# ValueError is raised, an appropriate error message is displayed.
