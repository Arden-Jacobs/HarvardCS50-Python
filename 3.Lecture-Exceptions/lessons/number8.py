# number8.py - Adds pass

# Define the main function
def main():
    # Call the get_int function to obtain a valid integer
    x = get_int()
    # Print the obtained integer
    print(f"x is {x}")

# Define the get_int function to get a valid integer input from the user
def get_int():
    while True:
        try:
            return int(input("What's x? "))  # Prompt the user for input and return the integer
        except ValueError:
            pass  # Use the "pass" statement to do nothing in case of ValueError

# Call the main function to start the program
main()



# Explanation:
# This code snippet continues from the previous example and introduces the "pass" statement in the "except" block.

# The main() function and the get_int() function remain the same as in the previous example.

# Inside the get_int() function, the "try" block attempts to convert the user input into an integer, and the "except"
# block is triggered if a ValueError exception is raised. However, unlike previous examples where the "except" block
# contained a print statement, in this case, the "except" block contains only the "pass" statement.

# The "pass" statement is a placeholder that does nothing when executed. It serves as a syntactical placeholder to
# indicate that the block of code is intentionally left empty. In this case, when a ValueError occurs, the "except"
# block does not perform any actions, allowing the loop to continue prompting the user for input.

# This usage of "pass" can be useful when you want to handle exceptions in a minimalistic way, without requiring any
# specific actions to be taken within the "except" block.

# The overall behavior of the program remains the same: it repeatedly prompts the user for input until a valid integer
# is provided, and then it prints the obtained integer.
