# hello0.py - Demonstrates a function to be tested

# Main function to run the program
def main():
    # Prompt the user for input and store it in the variable "name"
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    # Call the "hello()" function with the user's name as an argument
    hello(name)

# Function to print a greeting message
def hello(to="world"):
    # Print the greeting message using the provided or default name
    print("hello,", to)

# Check if the script is run directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Call the main function to start the program
    main()

# Explanation:
# This script demonstrates the use of a function to be tested.

# The main function "main()" runs the program. It prompts the user for input and stores it in the variable "name".
# It then calls the "hello()" function, passing the user's name as an argument.

# The "hello(to="world")" function takes an optional parameter "to" with a default value of "world". It prints a
# greeting message using the provided name or the default "world" if no name is provided.

# The "__name__ == '__main__':" check at the end of the script ensures that the main function is executed only
# when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.
